This script is very basic right now, but it seems to work great. It will load up all playlists on your spotify account and it will recreate them on google play.

Run ezportify.py with python and follow the instructions in the command prompt. You will need your google play username and password along with a spotify oauth token from https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-playlist-tracks/

Make sure you are on a stable internet connection, I have not coded in any fancy error handling yet.

This script is based on pyportify by rckclmbr https://github.com/rckclmbr/pyportify

Runs on windows!
