# EZPortify

Transfer all of your spotify playlists to google play.
Also spits out all playlists and their tracks to a text file.

### Preface

Feel free to check out my new version that runs directly in your browser. No need to download anything or give anyone your password! --> **[Portify.JS](https://github.com/jordam/portify.js/)**

### Instructions


Run ezportify.py with python and follow the instructions in the command prompt. You will need your google play username and password along with a spotify oauth token from https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-current-user-playlists/

If you are unable to sign in to your Google account, turn on access for less secure apps here: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps/  
You may turn it off after the program has completed.

Run ezportify.py -h for help (ezportify.exe -h for windows users)

### Windows Users
I have included ezportify.exe in win32.zip. If you are not comfortable with python you can download and extract win32.zip then run ezportify.exe to get going right away. **[< WINDOWS DOWNLOAD >](https://github.com/jordam/ezportify/raw/master/win32.zip)**
